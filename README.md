Problem statement
Develop an AI-powered system that automatically validates and assesses the quality of open-ended text responses in market
research surveys. The system should be able to identify and flag low-quality responses including gibberish text, bot-
generated content, off-topic answers, copy-pasted content, and inappropriate language. This will replace the current manual
review process where human reviewers have to read through thousands of responses to ensure data quality.
